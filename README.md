Mandatory Changes: to check your course avaliability you just need to do Two changes in attached main.py file

(1) Change 1: 
			  
			  in line number 9 of main.py file just add your course code and maximum allowed limit for that course 
              
              example: let's say you want to check course CLL786 and maximum allowed limit for this course is 55 
              so our line 9 would be hul_dictionary = {'CLL786': '55'} in this case to add more courses use comma for sepration

(2) Change 2:  
			   
			   step 1 -> This is going to be tricky, first logout from your academica1.iitd account

               step 2 -> Then go to https://academics1.iitd.ac.in and login with your id and password

                         in a Course IInd semester 2016-2017"
               
               step 4 -> Now you will see a edit-box with label "Enter Course Code" and a button 
                         with label "Submit", so far everything is good
               
               step 5 -> Now for a course "HUL211" and click Submit button and wait for the list 
                         of registered students to display
               
               step 6 -> Last Step, now just copy the url of this page (page with list showing) 
                         this will be your unique url, put this url in line number 37 of given main.py file
